# The Overcomer's 365-Day Bible Reading Plan

## Overview

The Overcomer's 365-Day Bible Reading Plan is an interactive, web-based Bible reading tracker that guides you through Scripture in one year. Organized around the 22 Hebrew letters (Aleph through Tav), this plan provides a unique framework for discovering Christ throughout the entire Bible.

## What Makes This Plan Unique

**Hebrew Letter Framework**: Each of the 22 Hebrew letters represents a section of the reading plan, with symbolic meanings that point to Christ, the Church, and spiritual truths. From Aleph (א - "The Beginning") to Tav (ת - "The Covenant"), each letter provides a thematic lens for understanding Scripture.

**Three Daily Readings**: 
- **Old Testament**: Foundation narratives and prophecies
- **Minor Prophets**: God's voice through the prophets
- **New Testament**: Fulfillment in Christ and the early Church

**Comprehensive Coverage**: Read through major portions of the Old Testament, all Minor Prophets, and the entire New Testament in one year, with each day's readings carefully selected to reveal Christ and His redemptive work.
